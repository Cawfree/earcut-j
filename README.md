earcut-j
======

A pure Java port of Vladimir Agafonkin's excellent earcut, the fastest and smallest Javascript polygon triangulation library. This will also work quite nicely on Android.

The latest version is based on earcut 1.2.2, and is funtionally equivalent as the original project, but has some minor Java-specific features to aid runtime performance and encapsulation. 

The original project can be found here:
